>>> write a complete python function that would Obtain API token from [D-Wave Leap](https://cloud.dwavesys.com/leap/)
To obtain an API token from D-Wave Leap, you typically need to have an account and follow the authentication process as outlined 
in their documentation. The process usually involves making a request to their authentication endpoint with your credentials 
(e.g., username and password) or another form of authentication they support.

Below is a Python function that demonstrates how to obtain an API token from D-Wave Leap using basic authentication (username 
and password). This example assumes you have `requests` library installed, which you can install via pip if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install requests
```

Here's the Python function:

```python
import requests
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth

def obtain_dw_api_token(username: str, password: str) -> str:
    """
    Obtain an API token from D-Wave Leap.

    Parameters:
    - username (str): Your D-Wave Leap account username.
    - password (str): Your D-Wave Leap account password.

    Returns:
    - api_token (str): The obtained API token, or None if the request fails.
    """

    # Define the authentication endpoint URL
    auth_url = "https://cloud.dwavesys.com/leap/api/v1/auth/login"

    try:
        # Make a POST request to the login endpoint with your credentials
        response = requests.post(auth_url, auth=HTTPBasicAuth(username, password))

        # Check if the request was successful
        if response.status_code == 200:
            # Assuming the API token is returned in JSON format within 'token' key
            api_token_response = response.json()
            api_token = api_token_response.get('token')
            return api_token
        else:
            print(f"Failed to obtain API token. Status code: {response.status_code}")
            return None

    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        # Handle any exceptions that occur during the request
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage (replace 'your_username' and 'your_password' with your actual credentials)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    username = "your_username"
    password = "your_password"
    api_token = obtain_dw_api_token(username, password)
    if api_token:
        print(f"Obtained API token: {api_token}")
```

**Important Notes:**

1. **Authentication Method**: This example uses basic authentication with a username and password. Depending on the current 
D-Wave Leap API documentation, you might need to use a different method (e.g., OAuth2) for authentication.
2. **API Endpoint**: Ensure that the `auth_url` points to the correct endpoint as specified in the D-Wave Leap API 
documentation. APIs evolve, so it's crucial to check the latest documentation.
3. **Response Format**: This example assumes the API token is returned in a JSON response under a 'token' key. Adjust the 
parsing logic according to the actual response format from the D-Wave Leap API.

Always refer to the most current [D-Wave Leap documentation](https://cloud.dwavesys.com/leap/) for up-to-date information on 
authentication and API usage.
